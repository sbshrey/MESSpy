GENERAL CONFIGURATION - INPUT_TEST_4

Simulation Parameters:
- Duration: 1 year
- Timestep: 60 minutes
- Location: Latitude 42.33°, Longitude 10.489°
- Time Zone: UTC+1 with DST
- Weather Data: TMY (Typical Meteorological Year)

System Overview:
This configuration represents a mixed end-use hybrid plant that integrates renewable energy
generation with industrial hydrogen production and end-use applications. The system is
designed to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of decarbonizing industrial
processes through renewable hydrogen integration.

The plant operates as a self-contained energy system that can both import and export
electricity to/from the grid, while producing hydrogen for industrial applications and
storing excess renewable energy for later use.
