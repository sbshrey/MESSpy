STUDY CASE CONFIGURATION - INPUT_TEST_4

This study case simulates a Mixed End-Use Hybrid Plant with the following key features:

ENERGY GENERATION:
- Wind Power: 150 MW capacity with power curve model
- Solar PV: 120 MW peak capacity with optimal tilt and azimuth
- Both technologies use TMY weather data for realistic generation profiles

ENERGY STORAGE:
- Battery Storage: 50 MWh capacity, 25 MW max power, 90% efficiency
- Large-scale Storage: 200 MWh capacity, 50 MW max power, 85% efficiency
- Both systems have appropriate SOC limits and self-discharge rates

HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Electrolyzer: 80 MW PEM system with hydrogen-first strategy
- Fuel Cell: 60 MW PEM system for electricity generation from stored hydrogen
- Compressor: 3-stage mechanical compressor for hydrogen pressurization
- Storage: 10,000 kg hydrogen storage capacity at 300 bar

END-USE FACILITIES:
- Steel Production: Integrated facility with electricity, heat, and hydrogen demands
- Ammonia Production: Chemical facility with constant hydrogen demand and variable electricity/heat

GRID INTEGRATION:
- Electricity grid: Bidirectional connection for import/export
- Gas grid: Import only for backup/auxiliary systems
- Water grid: Import only for electrolysis and industrial processes
- Hydrogen grid: Export only for external hydrogen supply
- Oxygen grid: Export only for industrial oxygen supply
