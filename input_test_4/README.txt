INPUT_TEST_4: Mixed End-Use Hybrid Plant Simulation

This test case simulates a comprehensive mixed end-use hybrid plant that integrates:
- Renewable energy generation (wind + solar)
- Energy storage systems (battery + large-scale storage)
- Hydrogen production and storage infrastructure
- Industrial end-use facilities (steel + ammonia production)

The system follows the GreenHEART process: Model Definition -> Simulation -> Optimization -> Analysis

Key Components:
1. Energy Section: Wind turbines (150 MW), Solar PV (120 MW), Battery storage (50 MWh), Large-scale storage (200 MWh)
2. Transmission Section: Power distribution system
3. Hydrogen Section: Electrolyzer (80 MW), Fuel cell (60 MW), Compressor, Storage tanks
4. End-Use Section: Steel production facility, Ammonia production facility

Load Profiles:
- Main electricity, heat, and hydrogen demands
- Specific profiles for steel production
- Specific profiles for ammonia production

This test case demonstrates the integration of renewable energy with industrial processes
through hydrogen as an energy carrier, enabling decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors.
