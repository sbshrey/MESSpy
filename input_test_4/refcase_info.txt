REFERENCE CASE CONFIGURATION FOR INDIA
======================================

This file defines the reference case configuration for the Indian hybrid plant simulation.

SYSTEM INTEGRATION APPROACH:
The reference case establishes the baseline grid integration strategy for the hybrid plant
in the Indian energy market context.

GRID CONNECTION PRIORITIES:

1. ELECTRICITY GRID (Priority: 3)
   - Draw: Enabled - Import electricity during renewable energy shortfall
   - Feed: Enabled - Export excess renewable electricity to grid
   - Purpose: Grid balancing and revenue generation through power trading

2. GAS GRID (Priority: 2)
   - Draw: Enabled - Import natural gas for backup power generation
   - Feed: Disabled - No gas export capability
   - Purpose: Backup fuel for CHP systems and emergency power

3. WATER GRID (Priority: 4)
   - Draw: Enabled - Import process water for electrolysis and industrial use
   - Feed: Disabled - No water export capability
   - Purpose: Essential resource for hydrogen production and industrial processes

4. HYDROGEN GRID (Priority: 5)
   - Draw: Disabled - No external hydrogen import
   - Feed: Enabled - Export excess green hydrogen to market
   - Purpose: Revenue generation and market penetration for green hydrogen

5. OXYGEN GRID (Priority: 6)
   - Draw: Disabled - No external oxygen import
   - Feed: Enabled - Export oxygen byproduct from electrolysis
   - Purpose: Additional revenue stream from industrial oxygen sales

INDIAN MARKET CONTEXT:
- Grid stability support through renewable energy integration
- Green hydrogen market development and export
- Industrial oxygen supply for steel and chemical industries
- Backup power capability for grid reliability
- Water resource management for arid regions

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY:
- Maximize renewable energy utilization
- Minimize grid dependency during normal operation
- Provide grid services during renewable energy shortfall
- Generate revenue through multiple energy carrier exports
- Support India's energy transition goals

Note: This configuration aligns with Indian energy policy objectives and market conditions.
