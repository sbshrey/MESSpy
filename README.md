## Overview
The Multi-Energy System Simulator has been developed to perform techno-economic assesment of Renewable Energy Communities (REC), but can also be used to study single-standing buildings and hydrogen-integrated energy systems.
It can simulate hourly balances of the energy flows between technologies of each location (building) inside the REC and calculate the Net Present Value of each considering the interaction with the national grid given different incentive schemes. The program has been developed to be as general as possible so it can be used to simulate a wide range of different case studies while easily changing their configuration or parameters,both technical and economic.
The code is extensively commented and can be easily used either as a black box by simply modifying the inputs and working on results or by directly modifying the code.

It's an object oriented program structured on three levels: REC, location and technologies.
Models of different technologies are avialable and still under development to include new fetures and more realistic detalis. At the current stage the following technologies can be included in the simulations:
- Photovoltaic panels
- Wind turbines
- Batteries
- Electrolyzers
- Steam Methane Reformer
- Fuel Cells
- Hydrogen tanks
- Hydrogen compressors
- Heat pumps
- Boilers (NG, electric or H2)
- CHP (combined heat and power)

### MESS needs the load profiles as input as a .csv file
Depending on the type of meter installed, these data is in some cases made available by the electricity/gas supplier, in others it must be requested, while sometimes it cannot be obtained. In the latter case, specific programmes are required to generate such profiles in the specific .csv format needed as one of the program inputs. There are many programmes available online, the authors recommend the following:\
bottom-up model: https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP \
bottom-up model: https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe \
top-down model: https://github.com/PasquinoFI/LoBi \
top-down model: https://github.com/PasquinoFI/LoBi_residenziale_GSE

### Timestep
Simulation timestep can vary from 1 to 60 minutes. The time horizon from 1 year to as many years as you want.

### Requirements
The model is developed in Python 3.9, and requires the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- os
- pickle (results can be saved in .pickle)
- csv (results can be saved in csv)
- json (input files are .json)
- pvlib (used to download PV production series and weather data based on typical meteorological year)
- matplotlib (used in post_process)

A less up-to-date but fully functional and documented fortran version is also available:
https://github.com/pielube/MESS-Fortran

## Quick start
Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download: recommended to handle virtual environments and package versions.

From Anaconda Prompt, install git, choose folder, clone repository, create the virtual environment and install Spyder (Authors usually use Spyder as IDE)
- conda install git
- cd path/to/your/folder
- git clone https://github.com/pielube/MESSpy.git
- cd MESSpy/env
- conda env create -f MES.yaml
- conda activate MES
- conda install spyder
- spyder

You can run examples now. Three examples analysis are available:
- "run_test_1" A small energy community composed by two consumers and one prosumer with PV and battery. A sensisivety analysi is also carried out.
- "run_test_2" A residential building replaces the gas boiler with a heat pump
- "run_test_3" On-site hydrogen production plant for an industrial facility 

Choose one of these, read it and press run!

### Input files
You can modify them from a python interface or simply from notepad. The "Input_test" folder contains a demonstration case study. 
- general.json defines the general input. More details can be found in rec.py prologue comments.
- studycase.json defines the structure of the case study. Here you can define all the locations to consider, each technology inside the locations and technology's parameters. More detalis can be found in rec.py and location.py comments to the code.
- refcase.json This file has the same structure of structure.json and defines the "buiseness as usual" case, which is used as a reference case for calculating the cash flows of the study case and performing the economic assessment.
- energy_market.json defines economic parameters. More details can be found in the comments of economics.py
- tech_cost.json defines economic parameters. More details can be found in the comments of economics.py

### Output files
Results are saved in both .pkl and .csv

### How to continue
We suggest you to create your own run_dev.py, input_dev/ and post_process_dev.py and to work on them instead of modifying the existing file used as initial test.
